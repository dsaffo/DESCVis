# VisConnect

Online collaboration on visualizations. Events, such as clicking,
are synchronized across collaborators. Check out the website at 
[visconnect.us](http://visconnect.us).

After opening the link, click on the connect button on the bottom right and paste the copied url into another browser tab/client.
The two wepages should now be synchronized.

For development, to recompile the bundle, run
`npm run compile` after running `npm i`.

More info can be found in the preprint of our research paper at [osf.io/ut7e6](https://osf.io/ut7e6/).
